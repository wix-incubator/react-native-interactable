# Props Reference

## `Interactable.View` Props

#### `snapPoints` (array of points)

```jsx
snapPoints={[{x: 0}, {x: -200}]}
```

A list of points the view will snap to after being dragged by the user. To implement a a drawer for example, provide 2 points - one for the open state and one for the closed state. Points are relative to the view's center (after initial layout). Every element in the array is an object with the following properties:

* `x` - The horizontal position (relative to the center). Optional if a single dimension is needed.
* `y` - The vertical position (relative to the center). Optional if a single dimension is needed.
* `damping` - Amount of damping on the spring connected to this point. Default is `0.7`.
* `tension` - Tension of the spring connected to this point. Default is `300`.
* `id` - An optional string name for the point to identify it in the `onSnap` event.

#### `animatedValueX` (Animated.Value)

```jsx
animatedValueX={this._deltaX}
```

[`Animated.Value`](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/animated.html#animatedvalue) that will contain the delta from the center as the view moves (x axis). See [this](README.md#animating-other-views-according-to-interactableview-position) for more details on how to animate other views according to the movement of this view.

#### `animatedValueY` (Animated.Value)

```jsx
animatedValueY={this._deltaY}
```

[`Animated.Value`](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/animated.html#animatedvalue) that will contain the delta from the center as the view moves (y axis). See [this](README.md#animating-other-views-according-to-interactableview-position) for more details on how to animate other views according to the movement of this view.

#### `animatedNativeDriver` (boolean)

```jsx
animatedNativeDriver={false}
```

Whether integration with [Animated](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/animated.html) should use native driver. Default `false` since Animated native driver is still a bit experimental. Try it out as eventually the quirks will be resolved and then we'll have a 100% native driver end to end with 60 FPS on derived animations as well.

#### `initialPosition` (point)

```jsx
initialPosition={{x: -140, y: -280}}
```

Optional, used to initialize the view's position to a position different than it's original center. This is mostly useful when you want to provide `snapPoints` points relative to the center calculated by React Native layout, but want the view itself to start from a different position. See [chat heads](https://github.com/wix/react-native-interactable/blob/b72eff0649b48dd50548593e5ecfe4c42b026a02/example/src/ChatHeads.js#L22) example.
